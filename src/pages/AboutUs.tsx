                        <p className="w-96 p-4 "> As students, we've noticed we use numerous websites for school tasks  each year. Many serve just one purpose, like forums or homework  submission. Professors often use different platforms, making it hard to  keep track. We believe there should be a simpler way to stay organized  and manage school information.</p>

                        <p className="w-96 p-4">Our goal is to help student reach academic success. By providing one place where students can see all their course information, our solution helps students stay organized, reduce stress and have more time to focus on their school work rather than managing different student platformsÂ </p>
